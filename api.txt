This endpoint creates a draft invoice for a given customer. 
The draft invoice created pulls in all pending invoice items on that customer, including prorations. 
The invoice remains a draft until you finalize the invoice, which allows you to pay or send the invoice to your customers.
Returns an invoice object if a valid invoice ID was provided. Throws an error otherwise.
Draft invoices are fully editable. Once an invoice is finalized, monetary values, as well as collection_method, become uneditable.
